## How Cifiction was founded

Cifiction was founded at the end of 2022 as a merger of the two networks PixelSlide (CityBuild) and Rezureax (Minigames & Training). 
In the spring of 2023, however, it was paused because the project management is currently quite involved with school and university.

## About our concept

Our dream is to implement a looter shooter in Minecraft - for and by the community. 
Among other things, we therefore want the open world to be designed by the community itself through a survival server.

You can find our entire public concept [here](https://wiki.cifiction.net).
