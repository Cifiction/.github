## How Cifiction was founded

Cifiction was founded at the end of 2022 as a merger of the two networks PixelSlide (CityBuild) and Rezureax (Minigames & Training). 
In the spring of 2023, however, it was paused because the project management is currently quite involved with school and university.

## About our concept

Our dream is to implement a looter shooter in Minecraft - for and by the community. 
Among other things, we therefore want the open world to be designed by the community itself through a survival server.

You can find our entire public concept [here](https://wiki.cifiction.net).

### [Game Developer](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/SchematicBrushReborn)
Schematic Brush Reborn is a revive of the old [Schematic Brush](https://github.com/mikeprimm/SchematicBrush) and the successor of Schematic Brush Reborn V1.

However it is not really the old schematic brush and has a way better usability.
It features several new features which will make creating Schematic Brushes as simple as possible!
It also adds several new features like block place masks, new modifiers, realtime preview and modification.

We also have several Add-ons for it like [Grid Selector](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/gridselector),
[Schematic Brush Database](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/schematic-brush-database),
[Schematic Tools](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/schematic-tools),
[Survival Schematic Brush](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/survivalschematicbrush)
