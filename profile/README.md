## How Cifiction was founded

Cifiction was founded at the end of 2022 as a merger of the two networks PixelSlide (CityBuild) and Rezureax (Minigames & Training). 
In the spring of 2023, however, it was paused because the project management is currently quite involved with school and university.

## About our concept

Our dream is to implement a looter shooter in Minecraft - for and by the community. 
Among other things, we therefore want the open world to be designed by the community itself through a survival server.

You can find our entire public concept [here](https://wiki.cifiction.net).

## Noteable Projects

These are some of our most notably projects. We invested a lot of time in these and are happy to publish the source code here.

### [Schematic Brush Reborn](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/SchematicBrushReborn)
Schematic Brush Reborn is a revive of the old [Schematic Brush](https://github.com/mikeprimm/SchematicBrush) and the successor of Schematic Brush Reborn V1.

However it is not really the old schematic brush and has a way better usability.
It features several new features which will make creating Schematic Brushes as simple as possible!
It also adds several new features like block place masks, new modifiers, realtime preview and modification.

We also have several Add-ons for it like [Grid Selector](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/gridselector),
[Schematic Brush Database](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/schematic-brush-database),
[Schematic Tools](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/schematic-tools),
[Survival Schematic Brush](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/survivalschematicbrush)

### [Pick Me Up](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/PickMeUp)
Do you find leashes as boring as I do?

If yes: PickMeUp is your plugin! If no: You gonna love it anyway!

Pick me Up allows you to pick up every existing entity.
You can enable and disable pick up for every entity (Players as well if you want).
You can also define a permission for every entity.
Because this is not enough and just let them down again is lame you can throw them away.
And yes you can pickup someone who picked up someone. Reach the sky!

### [Big Doors Opener](https://github.com/eldoriarpg/BigDoorOpener)

Big doors opener is an addon for [Big Doors](https://github.com/PimvanderLoos/BigDoors).

Big doors opener allows you to open doors based on conditions.
These conditions can be items, which the player needs to activate at a specific block or just hold it in its hand.
Or you can open a door when a player is near it or inside a specific region.
You can also open a door based on a player permission, world time or the weather.
