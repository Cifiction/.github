## About our foundation
Rezureax was originally intended as a Minecraft Minigames server. However, over time, interest in 1.8 minigames servers has waned. So the project ended. However, part of the team didn't want to break away from Minecraft development and so Rezureax was founded again with the aim of making high-quality plugins available to everyone.

Big doors opener is an addon for [Big Doors](https://github.com/PimvanderLoos/BigDoors).

Big doors opener allows you to open doors based on conditions.
These conditions can be items, which the player needs to activate at a specific block or just hold it in its hand.
Or you can open a door when a player is near it or inside a specific region.
You can also open a door based on a player permission, world time or the weather.
